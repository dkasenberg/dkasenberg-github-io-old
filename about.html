<p>I am a graduate student at Tufts University, pursuing a joint PhD in <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://cogsci.tufts.edu/">Cognitive Science</a>, working in the <a href="https://hrilab.tufts.edu/">Human-Robot Interaction Lab</a> (HRILab) with Professor Matthias Scheutz.  I am originally from Ontario, Canada, and my undergraduate studies were at the <a href="https://www.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, where I double-majored in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.</p>

<p>My current work at the HRILab deals principally with incorporating moral and social norms into artificial agents. <!-- read a little more about it <a href="{ link research.md }">here</a>.</p>-->

<p>When I am not doing research, I may be singing in an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OutofRangeACappella/">a cappella group</a>, or enjoying (and more recently <a href="https://www.afdtheatre.org/single-post/2018/12/10/Announcing-our-great-cast-for-Witness">acting in</a>) local community theater.</p>
