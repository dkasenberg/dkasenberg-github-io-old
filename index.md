I am a graduate student in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at Tufts University.  My research is primarily focused on the development of morally competent artificial agents.  My long-term research goal is to develop agents that can learn (both from observing othersâ€™ behavior and from direct instruction), obey, reason about, and communicate sophisticated (and sometimes conflicting) human moral and social norms.
